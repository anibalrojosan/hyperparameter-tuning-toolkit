# Development Log: Hyperparameter Tuning Toolkit

## [2026-02-08]
### Project Kickoff & Strategic Alignment
#### Achievements
- Defined the project's evolution towards a **Production-Ready Hyperparameter Tuning Service**.
- Agreed on a modern 2026 tech stack: `uv`, `FastAPI`, `MLflow`, `Evidently AI` to extend the existing Core ML stack: `Optuna`, `DEAP`, `Scikit-Learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`.
- Established a 4-phase progression plan and created the technical `ROADMAP.md` document.

#### Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Deciding between a research-focused or engineering-focused path.
- **Solution:** Opted for the **MLOps Motor** approach to demonstrate infrastructure skills.

#### Next Steps
- Initialize the `uv` environment and migrate dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Start refactoring the core logic into a modular structure.

## [2026-02-08] - Update
### ROADMAP Refinement
- Added existing Core ML stack (Optuna, DEAP, Scikit-Learn) to `docs/ROADMAP.md` to provide a complete overview of the project's technology.
